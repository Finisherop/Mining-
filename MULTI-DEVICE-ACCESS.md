## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### ❌ Can't Connect from Other Devices?

1. **Check Same WiFi Network**

   ```cmd
   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Vite" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=3000
   ```

3. **Firewall Issues (Linux)**
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 3000
   ```

4. **Check IP Address**
   ```bash
   # Make sure you're using the correct IP
   hostname -I  # Linux
   ipconfig     # Windows
   ifconfig     # Mac
   ```

5. **Port Already in Use**
   ```bash
   # Kill process on port 3000
   npx kill-port 3000
   
   # Or use different port
   npm run dev -- --port 3001
   ```
